{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are given few useful crafting recipes to craft items in Minecraft. Crafting commands are of the format \"craft [target object] using [input ingredients]\". You can either \"fetch\" an object (ingredients) from the inventory or the environment or \"craft\" (target) using any of the crafting commands.\n\nYou can use ONLY these crafting commands provided, do not use your own crafting commands. However, if the crafting command uses a generic ingredient like \"planks\", you can use special types of the same ingredient e.g. \"dark oak planks\" in the command instead.\n\nFor any other natural language or thoughts, use prefix 'think: '.\n\nHere is a demo of how to fetch and craft objects.\n\nGoal: craft dark oak sign\n\n> think: I should check if I can fetch dark oak sign directly from the environment or the inventory.\nOK.\n\n> inventory\nInventory: [stick] (1) [dark oak planks] (8)\n\n> get dark oak sign\nCould not find dark oak sign\n\n> think: I cannot get dark oak sign directly, I need to craft it. From the crafting commands, I can use: craft dark oak sign using 6 dark oak planks, 1 stick. Ingredients needed: 6 dark oak planks, 1 stick.

Let me verify this first.\nOK.\n\n> inventory\nInventory: [stick] (1) [dark oak planks] (8)\n\n> think: I found my ingredients: 6 dark oak planks, 1 stick in my inventory.
