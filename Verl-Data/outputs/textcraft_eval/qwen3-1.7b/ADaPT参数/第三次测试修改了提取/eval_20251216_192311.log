You are given few useful crafting recipes to craft items in Minecraft. Crafting commands are of the format "craft [target object] using [input ingredients]". You can either "fetch" an object (ingredients) from the inventory or the environment or "craft" (target) using any of the crafting commands. 

You can use ONLY these crafting commands provided, do not use your own crafting commands. However, if the crafting command uses a generic ingredient like "planks", you can use special types of the same ingredient e.g. "dark oak planks" in the command instead. 

For any other natural language or thoughts, use prefix 'think: '.

Here is a demo of how to fetch and craft objects.

Goal: craft dark oak sign

> think: I should check if I can fetch dark oak sign directly from the environment or the inventory.
OK.

> inventory: 
Inventory: [stick] (1) [dark oak planks] (8)

> get dark oak sign
Could not find dark oak sign

> think: I cannot get dark oak sign directly, I need to craft it. From the crafting commands, I can use: craft dark oak sign using 6 dark oak planks, 1 stick. Ingredients needed: 6 dark oak planks, 1 stick. Input assumption: I have all the neccessary ingredients in my inventory. Let me verify this first.
OK.

> inventory
Inventory: [stick] (1) [dark oak planks] (8)

> think: I found my ingredients: 6 dark oak planks, 1 stick in my inventory. My assumption is true, I can proceed. I will use the crafting command: craft dark oak sign using 6 dark oak planks
OK.

> craft 1 dark oak sign using 6 dark oak planks, 1 stick
Crafted 1 minecraft:dark_oak_sign

> inventory 
Inventory: [dark oak sign] (1)

> think: I now have dark oak sign in my inventory. Task Completed!
OK.

Goal: fetch 2 dark oak logs.

> think: I should check my inventory first, to see if I already have dark oak sign. Otherwise, I will directly try to get it from the environment.
OK.

> inventory
Inventory: [stick] (1)

> get 2 dark oak logs.
Got 2 dark oak logs

> inventory
Inventory: [dark oak log] (2) [stick] (1)

> think: I have 2 dark oak logs in my inventory. Task Completed!
OK.

Now here is a different goal. You can use these crafting commands to accomplish the goal. When you have the desired item in your inventory, think: Task Completed! If you have tried your best but cannot proceed, think: task failed!

Crafting commands:
craft 1 sticky piston using 1 piston, 1 slime ball
craft 2 lead using 4 string, 1 slime ball
craft 1 magma cream using 1 blaze powder, 1 slime ball
craft 1 slime block using 9 slime ball

Goal: craft slime block.
